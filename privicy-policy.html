    <h1>Privacy Policy for SearchThatTerm</h1>

    <p>
        SearchThatTerm is a Chrome extension designed to help users understand selected text on web pages by providing
        AI-generated explanations and contextual follow-up answers.
    </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This privacy policy explains what data the extension accesses, how it is used, and under what conditions data is
        transmitted. The extension is designed to operate only on explicit user action and does not perform background
        data collection.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Accessed by the Extension</h2>
    <p>
        SearchThatTerm accesses the following data <strong>only when initiated by the user</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>User-selected text:</strong> Text that the user explicitly selects on a webpage and submits by
            clicking the ✨ button.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>User-provided API key:</strong> An OpenRouter API key entered by the user in the extension settings.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When Data Is Sent</h2>
    <p>
        No data is accessed or transmitted automatically. Data is sent only when:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The user selects text on a webpage</li>
        <li>The user explicitly triggers the extension by clicking the ✨ button or related action</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where Data Is Sent</h2>
    <p>
        Selected text is sent to <strong>OpenRouter</strong> (<code>https://openrouter.ai</code>) for the sole purpose
        of generating AI-based explanations and responses.
    </p>

    <p>
        SearchThatTerm does not directly communicate with individual AI model providers. All requests are routed through
        OpenRouter according to the user’s selected model.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The OpenRouter API key is stored locally using <code>chrome.storage</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The API key is not transmitted to any server other than OpenRouter.
        </li>
        <li>
            SearchThatTerm does not maintain its own backend and does not store user data.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What the Extension Does NOT Do</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Does not collect browsing history</li>
        <li>Does not monitor or log page content automatically</li>
        <li>Does not run background analytics or tracking</li>
        <li>Does not sell, share, or retain user data</li>
        <li>Does not inject advertisements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions Explanation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>activeTab:</strong> Used to access only the user-selected text on the currently active page after
            explicit user interaction.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>storage:</strong> Used to store the user’s OpenRouter API key and extension settings locally.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        SearchThatTerm relies on OpenRouter for AI responses. The handling of data by OpenRouter is governed by their
        own privacy policy and terms of service.
    </p>

    <h2>User Control</h2>
    <p>
        Users have full control over when the extension operates. If no action is taken, the extension remains inactive.
        The extension can be disabled or removed at any time through Chrome’s extension settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This privacy policy may be updated to reflect changes in functionality or compliance requirements. Any updates
        will be reflected on this page.
